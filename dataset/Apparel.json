Alignment / filing: reinserting the pins takes considerably more force than getting them out. However, as always, too much is too much - the problem being, if you do it for the first time, you don't know what is too little and what is much until it's too late. I had heard this can be a problem and had ordered extra pins just in case. At my very first try I didn't file the inside of the nose bridge bore much. Result: I wasn't able to push pin fully back in. I turned the frame around, pushed it back out, tried a new pin - it worked. On the other orbital, I had the same problem but couldn't even get the pin back out. It had deformed so much that it was moving neither back nor forth. Pulling its end with a caliper didn't help either. Wipe off the nervous sweat,  place the frame in the bench vice, get a 1.5mm drill and very carefully (!) drill a hole in the pin from the front. Make sure you don't touch the walls of the nose bridge bore (2mm diameter) - you don't want to widen the press-fit. Just pretend to be a dentist. When enough material is removed, pull out the culprit. Moral of the story: file, but don't grind. If the alignment isn't perfect the pin can get caught at an edge and will deform when pressure is applied. 2. Grinding down the pusher tip: Again, on my first try I hadn't done this enough (since I didn't know what was enough and how much is too much. 1.3mm diameter seems to work). This can result in very tiny spot marks on the back of the pin. Not bad at all but since you're at it... grind it down Additionally, you can try placing cardboard between the pusher tip and the pin.
