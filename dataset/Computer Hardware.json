The stand/pedestal may be attached by screws, or the back and the stand may all be one unit. Keep the screws you removed with the plastic back. That way they won't get mixed up with the screws you take out of the internal parts. There is also probably some sort of snap-on device molded into the plastic back. In the video, a piece of steel is used. A screwdriver or a piece of strong, flat plastic can also do the job. Snapping the back off should take some strength; however, too much force will permanently damage the plastic. Start with very little force and poke the edges of the back.
