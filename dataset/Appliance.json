To unsolder a relay, start by heating the solder at one end of the relay, and gently pull the relay's plastic package with a finger on the hand holding the circuit board. Use solder wick to remove excess solder.  After making progress at one end, switch to desoldering the contacts at the other end of the relay in the same fashion. To clean a relay, open its plastic case. Blow out the dust and grit.  Dress the relay contacts with a small piece of folded-in-half 200-400 grit sandpaper, treated with contact cleaner.
