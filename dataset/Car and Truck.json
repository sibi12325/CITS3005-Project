There are two different methods for removing the brake drum on the Focus. One removes both the drum and the rear wheel bearing, and one removes just the drum. If you are replacing the brake drums, then follow the appropriate directions for your replacement part: with or without the bearing installed. If you are not replacing the drums, keep in mind that the rear wheel hub bolt that holds the bearing in place must be torqued to 175 ft-lbs.", "Images": ["https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/SXUjDvgZdZG6MY4u.standard"], "StepId": 26725, "Tools_extracted": ["wheel chocks"]}, {"Order": 2, "Lines": [{"Text": "this step is for removing the brake drum and the wheel bearing together ."}, {"Text": "use a mallet and a flat head screwdriver to make a small indentation along the edge of the wheel bearing dust cap ."}, {"Text": "pry the dust cap out of the brake drum with the flat head screwdriver ."}, {"Text": "remove the 29 mm rear hub bolt nut from the brake drum . this will require either a breaker bar or an impact wrench ."}, {"Text": "this nut is torqued to 175 ft-lbs , and should not be removed more than four times . use a permanent marker to make a mark on the nut each time it is removed ."}], "Text_raw": "This step is for removing the brake drum and the wheel bearing together.
