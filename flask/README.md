# CITS3005 PROJECT

## Installation
The following software should be downloaded prior to installation
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 * [Python - 3.12.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 * An IDE - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Recommended

#### 1. Check your Python version
In a terminal run:
 * `python` / `python3` to check your python version (can run `exit()`) to close python terminal
 * `python -m pip` or `pip` to confirm pip is funtioning
 * `python -m venv` to check python's inbuilt environment manager is functioning

#### 2. Open the flask directory
Enter the flask directory before creating any virtual environments.

#### 3. Create and Activate Your Virtual Environment with venv
 1. Run `python3 -m venv venv` in the terminal to create your virtual environment. 
 2. Activate your venv using `.\venv\Scripts\activate` for windows or with `source venv/bin/activate` if using a linux based command line - you will need to activate the environment whenever you plan to run code within the project.
 3. Install any packages in the virtual environment:
     * On initial setup dependancies can be installed from the `requirements.txt` file by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt` __within the virtual environment__ - `(venv)` should be visible in your command line

#### 4. Run the Flask Application
Now that all the setup is completed you are ready to code and to run the application. This can be done with `flask run` in the terminal
